# text2sql
Using AWS Athena, do generate SQL from Text prompts and run them on Athena

Lot of code is lifted from blogs/Simple-text-to-sql/mda_with_llm_langchain_byo_model_without_cloudformation.ipynb

Most of the times, issues are more of library incompatibility when ran in AWS Sagemaker environments.
